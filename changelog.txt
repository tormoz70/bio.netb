SmartGit 3 early-access build 7 (2012-01-03)
============================================
Note:
- for Linux the system tray support has been disabled by default (because
  system trays should be replaced by so-called application indicators in
  future Ubuntu-releases). To enable it, set the VM option
  smartgit.ui.systemtray.linux.enabled to true

-------------------------

  - separated in Branches and Tags tabs
  - more compact branch display (similar to Switch)
  - improved speed-search
- automatic clean-up: is now performed only when idle, not directly when
  opening a project
- Push advanced dialog: checkbox-list; log-like branch and tag display
- Switch dialog: improved speed-search
- Log, Delete dialog (if there are multiple deletable references): log-like
  branch and tag display
- Setup wizard: can find hg executable in path and lets the user configure
  it manually
